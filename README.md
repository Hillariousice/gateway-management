# Gateway Management System

The Gateway Management System is a web application designed to manage network gateways using a user-friendly interface. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete gateways, as well as manage their associated devices.

## Features

- **Gateway Management**: Add, view, update, and delete network gateways.
- **Device Management**: Associate devices with gateways, view connected devices, and manage device details.
- **RESTful API**: Utilizes Express to provide a robust and scalable API for data manipulation.
- **Database Storage**: Data persistence using MongoDB for storing gateway and device information.
- **Frontend Interface**: Built with React for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- **Type Safety**: Implemented using TypeScript to enhance code readability and maintainability.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- MongoDB

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hillariousice/gateway-management.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd gateway-management-system
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   # Install server dependencies
   cd server
   npm install

   # Install client dependencies
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory and set up environment variables, including MongoDB connection string, JWT secret, etc.

5. Start the development servers:

   ```bash
   # Start the backend server (runs on http://localhost:5000 by default)
   cd ../server
   npm start

   # Start the frontend development server (runs on http://localhost:3000 by default)
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```

6. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

The API endpoints available in the Gateway Management System are as follows:

- `GET /api/gateways`: Retrieve all gateways.
- `GET /api/gateways/:_id`: Retrieve a specific gateway by ID.
- `POST /api/gateways`: Create a new gateway.
- `PUT /api/gateways/:id`: Update an existing gateway by ID.
- `DELETE /api/gateways/:id`: Delete a gateway by ID.
- `GET /api/gateways/:gatewayId/devices`: Retrieve devices associated with a specific gateway.
- `POST /api/gateways/:gatewayId/devices`: Add a device to a gateway.
- `DELETE /api/gateways/:gatewayId/devices/:deviceId`: Remove a device from a gateway.
